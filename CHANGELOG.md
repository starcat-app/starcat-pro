# Starcat Changelog

All notable changes to Starcat are summarized here for release notes.

## 1.5.0-待发布

Starcat 1.5.0 continues the Activity inbox so you can handle Issue / PR status, filters, event history, and image comments in the app, and review README documents, videos, security advisories, and release assets without leaving Starcat.

### New

- Agent multi-runtime: Switch the Agent workspace between the built-in runtime, Codex App Server, and DeepSeek Harness while reusing Starcat repository context, knowledge retrieval, and product tools.
- Trained repository recommendations: The Direct edition now reads offline-trained results through the new recommendation pipeline while keeping the existing Similar Repositories entry and cache behavior.
- Public Star contribution: An optional, off-by-default privacy setting can anonymously contribute public repository IDs and available Star dates to improve recommendations; uploads stay silent and never block normal sync.
- In-app repository documents: Enable in Settings to open same-repo Markdown links in a Starcat window; the default remains the browser, and Command-click always uses the browser.
- README video playback: Play supported GitHub README videos inline with native controls; playback requires an explicit action and stops when switching repositories or closing the detail view. Unsupported sources continue to open in the browser.
- Repository security advisories: Review the five latest published advisories in Insights with severity, GHSA / CVE identifiers, publication date, and publisher, then open an advisory or the complete list on GitHub.
- Insights release assets: See the latest release’s first 3 attachments under Release Cadence, expand to view all, then copy links or download them.
  ![20260823013144_YdoureTM](https://cdn.dong4j.site/source/image/20260823013144_YdoureTM.png)
- Notification Issue / PR status: Open, Closed, and Merged appear under the timestamp and on the detail header; closing or reopening a thread updates both.
- Notification library badges and filters: Star, Unstar, and Fork rows show In Library or Not in Library. Filter by Open, Closed, Merged, In Library, or Not in Library.
- Paste images in comments: Paste a screenshot or image into an Issue / PR comment to upload it and insert the link; Preview shows the image.

- Issue labels: Opening posts show the title and all labels, wrapping as needed; empty bodies show “No description.”
- Issue event timeline: Turn on Show issue events in Settings to insert label changes, closes, commit references, and related PRs between comments. Comments only by default.

### Improvements

- Agent workspace: The execution timeline now exposes reasoning summaries, tool calls, errors, and artifacts, with structured step details and run metrics in the inspector.
- Timeline empty detail: An illustration prompts you to pick an event in the middle column.
- Issue event cache: Reopening an Issue after quitting still reads comments and events locally first. Clear it in Settings → Storage.
- Issue comment drafts: Unsent handwritten or AI replies stay with each thread after you switch Issues or quit. Clear them in Settings → Storage.

### Fixes

- README translation on repo change: Switching repositories during translation no longer writes the previous README’s translation into the current detail view.
- Event-timeline translation: Opening posts and every comment get side-by-side translations; event rows stay original.
- Comment box on thread change: Switching Issues collapses the AI reply box and stops generation so drafts do not carry over.
- Timeline library toggle: Adding a repository to the library updates the badge only, keeping the current item and its detail open.

- Repository community signals: Correctly recognizes directory-based GitHub Issue Forms instead of showing them as missing.

## 1.4.0

Starcat 1.4.0 brings GitHub Notifications into Activity so you can handle mentions, review requests, and Issue / PR threads without leaving the app, while continuing to refine knowledge-base indexing and Explore.

Important update: Starcat's online services have been upgraded. Please update to 1.4.0 as soon as possible. Older versions can still display existing local cache, but online refresh, recommendations, Discovery, Wiki, and sharing will no longer be available.

### New

- GitHub notification inbox: Review mentions, review requests, assignments, discussions, releases, and security alerts in Activity. Filter by Unread, Mentions, Reviews, Issues, PRs, and more; group by Today, Yesterday, This week, and Earlier. All also interleaves your own Stars, Unstars, and Forks. The timeline distinguishes Issues from PRs; avatars and usernames open GitHub profiles, and Dependabot uses its official circular mark. Viewed items stay read, and the sync control spins while refreshing. Starcat asks to re-authorize if notification access is missing, and can post reminders in Notification Center.
  ![20260820212317_QsP1FsMm](https://cdn.dong4j.site/source/image/20260820212317_QsP1FsMm.png)
- Issue / PR threads: Open a notification to read the opening post and comments, write or preview a reply, and move to the previous or next item. Done matches GitHub Inbox Done and does not close the issue. Confirmed-open issues can be closed; closed issues can be reopened. Open the thread on GitHub, or the repository in Starcat.
- AI comment drafts: Generate a reply from the current thread, or polish text you already typed. The reply follows the thread language, not your draft or the app UI language.
- Thread translation: Translate the opening post and comments in segmented or full mode; titles, repository names, and the composer stay original. Target language can follow the app UI, paragraphs already in that language are skipped, and new translations fade in briefly.
- Local CLI inference: Direct builds can run Knowledge Base RAG through Codex CLI or Claude Code CLI; Settings detects installation, version, and path, with setup guidance when a CLI is missing.

### Improvements

- External CodebaseMemory runtime: Direct builds no longer bundle the large executable; Starcat can detect a current official installation or use one selected in Settings.
- Long thinking smoothness: Knowledge Q&A and repository AI chat stay responsive during long reasoning, and you can still expand to read the full text when it finishes.
- Last AI-index prefetch: Opening Settings shows when the last prefetch finished, with counts and green, orange, or red status icons.
- External index test status: Meilisearch and Qdrant each show their own result next to Test and Save, with green success, orange rebuild-needed, and red failure icons.
- Semantic search progress: Index refresh shows a busy ring immediately, then a determinate ring as up-to-date repos are skipped; only missing or stale vectors are rebuilt.
- Semantic relevance badge: Percent size matches Language, Stars, and Forks on the same row.
- Knowledge-base chunk status: Details distinguish whether a shard is still in the library from current-model embedding status.
- Knowledge-base embedding progress: Shows current-model coverage, no longer marks a previous run as finished, and can be viewed or paused from the toolbar status panel.
- Index issue shards: Open the knowledge base from pending, failed, or expired cards and jump to the matching chunk.
- Meilisearch keyword index: Text is synced at the start of a knowledge-base rebuild so keyword search works before embeddings finish.
- Knowledge-base Chinese search: Chinese infix matching, and named repositories more reliably land on indexed README content.
- Shortcut recorder: Expands the key display area and shows an inline reset-to-default control only after a shortcut is changed.
- README translation: Target language can be Auto (follows the app UI), same-language paragraphs are skipped, and new translations fade in briefly.
- Translation and AI-draft errors: Failures show as a bottom-right toast; incomplete AI setup can open Settings.
- First-run coaching: Replaces overlapping system tips with a single yellow capsule.
- Activity counts and help: List counts move to the system title-bar subtitle, and category help opens from the middle column.
- Notification timeline pagination: Preloads the next page around eight items before the end, keeping long timelines moving without waiting at the bottom.

### Fixes

- 3D code graph startup: Reuses the account-wide graph service and repository route, fixing valid installations being reported missing and shared-daemon cache conflicts causing port timeouts.
- Query planning timeline: Thinking is nested under Query planning, and the plan plus Context Plan panel appear only after planning actually finishes.
- Embedding cancel: Pausing vectorization no longer reports a network error or bounce the progress back.
- Global filter panel: Removes the noticeable delay when opening repository filters for faster access.
- Explore offline cache: Shows cached Discovery, Popular, and New Releases data immediately when the service is unavailable instead of leaving skeleton rows visible.
- Explore category counts: Restores cached Discovery, Popular, New Releases, and Weekly totals on first launch without opening each category.

## 1.3.0

Starcat 1.3.0 adds My Projects, library-wide and repository-level insights, macOS desktop widgets, reusable insight context for AI and RAG, and external search integrations for Alfred, uTools, and Raycast—helping you manage, understand, and rediscover repositories faster.

### New

- My Projects: Browse personal, organization, and external collaboration repositories; use GitHub App permissions for authorized public, private, and internal projects, with existing filters, details, and Star trends.
- My Insights: Review organization progress, technology distribution, project status, and items needing attention across all saved repositories or your Knowledge Base, then drill down to the matching repository list.
  ![20260730232032_p1AUnCiu](https://cdn.dong4j.site/source/image/20260730232032_p1AUnCiu.webp)
- Repository Insights: View Star growth, collaboration activity, commit trends, contributors, release cadence, project health, community standards, and security signals, with stable content while switching repositories or refreshing.
  ![20260730224524_01AnNgnJ](https://cdn.dong4j.site/source/image/20260730224524_01AnNgnJ.webp)
- Repository Insights Context: Reuse generated insights in AI summaries, repository conversations, and RAG answers through a removable read-only XML context, with distinct status for unavailable data, custom prompts that omit insights, and actual fallback.
- macOS desktop widgets: Starcat Focus, Rediscovery, Release Watch, and Star Trend show frequently used repositories, a daily rediscovery, unread releases, and recent starring growth with deep links to the corresponding content.
  ![20260730231856_O82ii1o3](https://cdn.dong4j.site/source/image/20260730231856_O82ii1o3.webp)
- Alfred Workflow: Search Starcat local repositories and GitHub directly from Alfred. [View project](https://github.com/starcat-app/starcat-alfred-workflow)
- uTools Plugin: Search Starcat local repositories and GitHub directly from uTools. [View project](https://github.com/starcat-app/starcat-utools-plugin)
- Raycast Extension: Search Starcat local repositories and GitHub directly from Raycast. [View project](https://github.com/starcat-app/starcat-raycast-extension)

### Improvements

- Shared insight aggregates: My Insights and repository insights data are used as context for RAG knowledge base Q&A.
- RAG Prompt Settings: Compare and copy read-only default prompts, with clearer Markdown formatting for Q&A and conversation compression templates.
- Custom Prompt Diagnostics: See which context capabilities and placeholders a custom template supports without Starcat automatically rewriting user content.
- First-run onboarding: Feature screenshots, refined welcome audio timing, clearer card hierarchy, and more stable window sizing.

### Fixes

- Share card theme controls: Uses full, contiguous click targets for style and color controls, eliminating missed clicks near edges and between buttons.
- RAG evidence citations: Metadata found through keyword search and Knowledge Base statistics now appear as actual cited snippets, so sources remain verifiable in answers and conversation history without vector indexing.

## 1.2.0

Starcat 1.2.0 focuses on stability, usability, and visual polish—adding an 18-language interface, pinning, share links, shortcuts, and README capabilities, while refining navigation, tags, notes, translation, and knowledge-base flows.

### New

- 18-language interface: Use Starcat in English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Dutch, Polish, Ukrainian, Turkish, Vietnamese, Indonesian, or Arabic.
- Repository pinning in Manage: Pin / Unpin, most-recently-pinned ordering, and a card-corner indicator.
- Repository share links: Open Starcat and locate the shared repository.
- Customizable app shortcuts: Search, refresh, open Knowledge RAG workspace and current-repo AI, with global and per-shortcut switches.
- README Mermaid diagrams: Local rendering with responsive sizing in narrow detail panes, and source fallback when rendering fails.
- README segmented and full translation: Segmented bilingual reading by default; full mode replaces visible text while keeping README structure.

### Improvements

- Add-tag popover: Clearer colored-icon rows and selection, with a solid window-matched background.
- Pro sidebar username gradient: Better light/dark adaptation, smoother first-letter color, and stronger light-mode contrast.
- Starred and Explore navigation: Clearer three-level hierarchy and filter context.
- README translation speed: Smaller first batch, incremental results, up to four concurrent requests, per-segment caching, and resume for unfinished segments.
- Personal notes: README-based AI generate/refine, visible progress, Markdown edit/preview, draft copy, and clearer save status.
- AI sharing: Reuse existing AI summaries; cancel creation and regenerate share links.
- Knowledge-base chunk management: Shard counts match language/stars sizing on cards; edit and detail views show last-updated time and approximate token counts.

### Fixes

- Knowledge Base entry: Fixes occasional no-response, minimized-window restore failure, and opening empty-library setup before index status finishes loading.

## 1.1.0

Starcat 1.1.0 turns saved repositories into a local-first, explainable RAG knowledge base, with broad performance, reliability, and macOS interface improvements.

### New

- Added a full knowledge-base RAG workspace with multi-repository context, streaming answers, citations, conversation groups, pinning, history, and draft recovery.
- Added hybrid retrieval across vector and bilingual keyword search, repository metadata, Wiki, RepoContext, optional reranking, live GitHub context, and external search.
- Added knowledge-base browsing and index management with batch Star imports, README completion, chunk editing and exclusion, targeted rebuilds, and index health checks.
- Added explainable RAG controls for query plans, execution timelines, retrieval funnels, context budgets, historical replay, retrieval settings, and debug export.
- Added a local AI usage dashboard for requests, tokens, latency, and failures without storing prompts or response content.
- Added global Star-status filters and AI-summary indicators for faster repository triage.

### Improvements

- Improved large-library and long-conversation performance with bounded indexing, batched vector work, incremental persistence, limited prefetching, and caching.
- Improved the RAG workspace with resizable columns, loading skeletons, richer citation panels, code and table copying, stable scrolling, and responsive typography.
- Improved AI settings and background jobs with clearer model capabilities, safer tag suggestions, actionable diagnostics, progress reporting, and cancel or skip controls.
- Improved Explore, Trending, and Weekly with shared snapshots, session caches, cancellation-safe switching, source filters, timelines, and stable loading states.

- Improved browser Companion workflows with configurable local ports, recommendation pagination, Star-state synchronization, and clearer availability feedback.
- Improved Direct Pro Pass activation, device management, seat-limit feedback, subscription cancellation, and channel-specific update controls.

### Fixes

- Fixed RAG scope isolation across repository or account switches, concurrent tasks, cancellations, and stale callbacks.
- Fixed retrieval and citation correctness for explicit repository scopes, private notes, bilingual keywords, Wiki content, excluded chunks, false citation markers, and no-evidence refusal.
- Fixed conversation stability for title generation, pin ordering, draft and history restoration, long-session compression, streaming timers, and scroll-to-bottom behavior.
- Fixed knowledge-base refresh and indexing issues, including unnecessary reloads, stale vectors overwriting new chunks, inaccurate source updates, and background Wiki refresh failures.
- Fixed browser-based GitHub sign-in, localized AI and RAG error feedback, and several settings, layout, and accessibility issues.
